### Introduction
This project is a pomodoro clock.
A pomodoro clock is basically a timer to be more efficient with your energy level when working on a task by taking a timed break after a session of work. It's usually a 25 minute session and a 5 minute break, but you can also modify it to your personal taste. I implemented a way to increase or decrease your session length and your break length. There's also a display of them. I made this project to mainly practice using React.
