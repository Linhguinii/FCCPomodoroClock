This project is a pomodoro clock.
A pomodoro clock is basically a timer to be more efficient with your energy level when working on a task by taking a timed break after a session of work. It's usually a 25 minute session and a 5 minute break, but you can also modify it to your personal taste.

I made this project to practice using React, a Javascript library.
